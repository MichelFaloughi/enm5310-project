# enm5310-project
My final project for the ENM 5310 class: Data-driven Modelling and Probabilistic Scientific Computing

Proposal ?
Find something that is not compute heavy... I can't build a full weather model that would take forever to compute...
Fine-tune aurora for some precipitation data ? helps predict floods ? perhaps ?

Fine-tuning aurora to predict variables it wasn't trained for masalan ! haha !



next meeting with Prof. Paris:
- Should we consider wind instead of precipitations ? Can we, given that one of Aurora's 4 tasks was hurricane tracking I believe, can we still fine-tune it to predict wind speeds ?




Questions:
- When we say 'Foundation model has a pre-training phase then a fine tuning phase on a smaller set of specialized data, this data is not seen in the pre-training phase right ? Hence, if I want to fine-tune Aurora, I would have to find exactly what data was used in the training of Aurora (ERA5 reanalysis) and know what NOT to use, mahek ?




Questions for me later:
- Be able to define what is the ERA5 Reanalysis dataset. Okay I know the big lines etc. But what is it, how big is it, what format is it, etc.
