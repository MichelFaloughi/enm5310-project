# enm5310-project
My final project for the ENM 5310 class: Data-driven Modelling and Probabilistic Scientific Computing

Questions for Prof. Paris:
- 'A100 with 80 GB' in the finetuning part of Aurora
- AuroraSmallPretrained apparently is only good for debugging, nothing else. They say we don't recommend any other use. Should I still fine-tune this ? I have no other choice do I.
- maybe theme the project: 'how good can we predict rainfall after finetuning with an 8gb gpu'


Questions for me later:
- Understand encoders and decoders better. I kinda do, but need more
- What the heck is a docker image
