# enm5310-project
My final project for the ENM 5310 class: Data-driven Modelling and Probabilistic Scientific Computing

Proposal ?
Find something that is not compute heavy... I can't build a full weather model that would take forever to compute...
Fine-tune aurora for some precipitation data ? helps predict floods ? perhaps ?

Fine-tuning aurora to predict variables it wasn't trained for masalan ! haha !
